Break, Continue
Sometimes we need more control over when a loop should end, or skip an iteration. 
In these cases, we use the break and continue keywords, which can be used in both for and while loops.

break terminates a loop
continue skips one iteration of a loop

Break the String
Write a loop with a break statement to create a string, news_ticker, that is exactly 140 characters long. 
You should create the news ticker by adding headlines from the headlines list, inserting a space in between each headline. 
If necessary, truncate the last headline in the middle so that news_ticker is exactly 140 characters long.

Remember that break works in both for and while loops. Use whichever loop seems most appropriate. 
Consider adding print statements to your code to help you resolve bugs

Check for Prime Numbers
Prime numbers are whole numbers that have only two factors: 1 and the number itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7.

For instance, 6 has four factors: 1, 2, 3, 6.
1 X 6 = 6
2 X 3 = 6
So we know 6 is not a prime number.

In the following coding environment, write code to check if the numbers provided in the list check_prime are prime numbers.

If the numbers are prime, the code should print "[number] is a prime number."
If the number is NOT a prime number, it should print "[number] is not a prime number", and a factor of that number, other than 1 and the number itself: "[factor] is a factor of [number]".
Example output:

7 IS a prime number
26 is NOT a prime number, because 2 is a factor of 26
"""
