# Why Object-Oriented Programming
"""
Object-oriented programming has a few benefits over procedural programming, which is the programming style you first learned.

Object-oriented programming allows you to create large, modular programs that can easily expand over time.
Object-oriented programs hide implementation from the end-userConsider Python package like scikit-learn, pandas, or numpy. 
These are all Python libraries built with object-oriented programming. 
Scikit-learn, for example, is a relatively large and complex package built with object-oriented programming. 
This package has expanded over the years with new functionality and new algorithms

##Object-oriented programming (OOP) vocabulary
"""
Class: A blueprint consisting of methods and attributes.

Object: An instance of a class. It can help to think of objects as something in the real world like a yellow pencil, a small dog, or a blue shirt.
However, as you'll see later in the lesson, objects can be more abstract.

Attribute: A descriptor or characteristic. Examples would be color, length, size, etc. These attributes can take on specific values like blue, 3 inches, large, etc.

Method: An action that a class or object could take.

OOP: A commonly used abbreviation for object-oriented programming.

Encapsulation: One of the fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming is called encapsulation: you can combine functions and data all into a single entity. In object-oriented programming, this single entity is called a class. 
Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details, much like how the scikit-learn package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms.
