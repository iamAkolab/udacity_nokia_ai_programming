# Extracurricular section
Notice that we provided you with an extracurricular section. In this section you will find additional useful lessons.

for example:

If you are completely new to Python, you will find our Intro to Python (Turtles and Code) lesson helpful.
If you have extra time and want to learn more about Machine Learning, you will find our Intro to Machine Learning lesson interesting.
Throughout the lessons, we will point you to additional extracurricular material when relevant.
