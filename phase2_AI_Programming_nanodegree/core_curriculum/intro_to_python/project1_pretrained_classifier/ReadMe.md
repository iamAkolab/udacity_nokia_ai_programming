# Project Instructions

## Principal Objectives
 * Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if the breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.
 * Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.
 * Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve objectives 1 and 2.
 * Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms takes to run.



## Program Outline
* Time your program
    * Use Time Module to compute program runtime
    
* Get program Inputs from the user
    * Use command line arguments to get user inputs
    
* Create Pet Images Labels
    * Use the pet images filenames to create labels
    * Store the pet image labels in a data structure (e.g. dictionary)

* Create Classifier Labels and Compare Labels
    * Use the Classifier function to classify the images and create the classifier labels
    * Compare Classifier Labels to Pet Image Labels
    * Store Pet Labels, Classifier Labels, and their comparison in a complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)

* Classifying Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs"
    * Classify all Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs" using dognames.txt file
    * Store new classifications in the complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)

* Calculate the Results
    * Use Labels and their classifications to determine how well the algorithm worked on classifying images

* Print the Results



You will need to repeat these tasks for each of the three image classification algorithms that are provided to you.
