#TODO: 1: Command Line Arguments
Fill code in the get_input_args() function to create & retrieve the command line arguments

Code to Edit
This section will help you code the function get_input_args within get_input_args.py. With this function, you will use argparse to retrieve three command line arguments from the user. (Argparse makes it easy to write user-friendly command-line interfaces).

Code for the function definition def get_input_args(): as indicated by #TODO: 1within get_input_args.py.
Expected Outcome
When completed, this code will input the three command line arguments from the user.

Checking your code
The check_command_line_arguments function within check_images.py will check your code.

Test the following:

Entering no command line arguments when you run check_image.py from the terminal window. This should result in the default values being printed.
Entering in values of your choice for the command line arguments when you run check_image.py from the terminal window. This should result in the values you entered being printed.
Project Workspace - Command Line Arguments
The next concept will have your workspace to work on #TODO: 1
Editing of check_image.py and get_input_args.py can be done within the Project Workspace - Command Line Arguments
For additional information and help on #TODO: 1, please look at the information below:
Purpose
The purpose of command line arguments is to provide a way for your programs to be more flexible by allowing external inputs (command line arguments) to be input into a program. The key is that these external arguments can change as to allow more flexibility in the program.

For example, imagine you wrote a program that simply counts the number of lines in a file and prints out that number to the screen. To allow the user to enter any file without having to change the program, one would want to pass in the file location as a command line argument. In this way, the program could be used on any file since the value is passed as an external input at runtime.

Usage of Argparse:
We will be using the argparse module to input the following external inputs into our program check_image.py. We recommend writing the get_input_args function to get the command line arguments using argparse.

Below are the three external inputs your check_image.py program will need to retrieve from the user along with the suggested default values each should have.

Folder that contains the pet images
pet_images/
The CNN model architecture to use
resnet, alexnet, or vgg (pick one as the default). You will find them in classifier.py.
The file that contains the list of valid dognames
dognames.txt
The get_input_args function will need to create an argument parser object using argparse.ArgumentParser and then use the add_argument method to allow the users to enter in these three external inputs from above.

Below is an example of creating an argument parser object and then using add_argument to add an argument that's a path to a folder and a second argument that's an integer.

# Creates Argument Parser object named parser
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()

# Argument 1: that's a path to a folder
parser.add_argument('--dir', type = str, default = 'pet_images/', 
                    help = 'path to the folder of pet images') 

Below you will find an explanation of the inputs into add_argument.

Argument 1:
--dir = The variable name of the argument (here it's dir)
type = The type of the argument (here it's a string)
default = The default value (here it's 'pet_images/')
help = The text that will appear if the user types the program name and then -h or --help. This allows the user to understand what's expected an argument's value
Accessing Argparse Arguments
To access the arguments passed into the program through your argparse object, you will need to use the parse_args method. The code below demonstrates how to access the arguments through the argparse extending the example above.

To begin, you will need to assign a variable to parse_args and then use that variable to access the arguments of your argparse object. If you are creating the argparse object within a function, you will need to return parse_args instead of assigning a variable to it. Also, note that the variable in_args points to a collection of the command line arguments.

This means to access the one we created in the code above, we have to reference the collection variable name in_args then specify the command line argument variable name dir. For this example, it would be in_args.dir, where in_args is the collection variable name and dir refers to the command line argument variable name. Notice that you need a dot (.) separating the two variable names. The code below shows the assignment of in_args to our parser and then accessing the value of in_args.dir with the print statement.

# Assigns variable in_args to parse_args()
in_args = parser.parse_args()

# Accesses values of Argument 1 by printing it
print("Argument 1:", in_args.dir)
Running a Program using command line arguments
To run a program like check_images.py, first, open a terminal window within the Project Workspace. Next, type the following and hit enter to run the program (this example - check_images.py). Because no command line arguments are specified after the program name (this example - check_images.py) this will use the default command line arguments that have been defined.

python check_images.py 
To run a program like check_images.py using the command line argument --dir, first, open a terminal window within the Project Workspace. Next, type the following and hit enter to run the program (this example - check_images.py). Notice that all command line arguments are specified after the program name (this example - check_images.py) and they are indicated by the -- that proceeds their variable name (this example: dir) with the value following the variable name (in this example the string: pet_images/).

python check_images.py --dir pet_images/
If you are having difficulty running check_images.py with command line arguments, see the example program call on line 23 of the program.
