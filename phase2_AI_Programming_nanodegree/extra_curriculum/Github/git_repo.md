## What is a Remote Repository?

Git is a distributed version control system which means there is not one main repository of information. Each developer has a copy of the repository. 
So you can have a copy of the repository (which includes the published commits and version history) and your friend can also have a copy of the same 
repository. Each repository has the exact same information that the other ones have, there's no one repository that's the main one.
